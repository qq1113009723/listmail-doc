# Messengers

listmail supports multiple custom messaging backends in additional to the default SMTP e-mail backend, enabling not just e-mail campaigns, but arbitrary message campaigns such as SMS, FCM notifications etc.

A *Messenger* is a web service that accepts a campaign message pushed to it as a JSON request, which the service can in turn broadcast as SMS, FCM etc. Messengers are registered in the *Settings -> Messengers* UI, and can be selected on individual campaigns.

Messengers support optional BasicAuth authentication. `Plain text` format for campaign content is ideal for messengers such as SMS and FCM.

When a campaign starts, listmail POSTs messages in the following format to the selected messenger's endpoint. The endpoint should return a `200 OK` response in case of a successful request.

The address required to broadcast the message, for instance, a phone number or an FCM ID, is expected to be stored and relayed as [subscriber attributes](concepts.md/#attributes). 

```json

	"subject": "Welcome to listmail",

		},
		"status": "enabled"
	}],
	"campaign": {
